# WebUI Rust (NON-COMPLETE)

Status: The Webui compiles but is untested so far.

Needs `webui-2-static-x64.lib` inary downloaded to run.

# NOTICE:

## The Rust wrapper still needs to be completed. You can finish it and submit the patch as PR. Thank you.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/webui-dev/rust-webui.git
cd rust-webui
cargo clean
cargo build
cargo run
```
